# Problem Statement
With the increasing volume of digital communication, spam messages have become a major nuisance, leading to security risks, phishing attacks, and wasted time. The goal of this project is to develop a Spam Detection System that classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam) using Machine Learning.

Our model utilizes the Random Forest algorithm,SVM and XGBoost Algorithm trained on a dataset of labeled spam and non-spam messages, to accurately predict and filter out spam messages. The solution is deployed as a Streamlit web application for ease of use and accessibility.

# Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing:

This project demonstrates how machine learning and NLP can effectively classify spam messages using TF-IDF and various classifiers. The comparison of SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost helps in choosing the best model for real-world spam detection systems.

# Deployment Using Streamlit

The Spam Detection Model is deployed using Streamlit, providing a simple and interactive web interface.
